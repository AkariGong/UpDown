This folder includes all processed data files collected from the UpAndDown experiments in ./processed/2022. 

Each pair of data includes a csv document of 3D coordinate position data of five tail points and a csv document of tail-beat cycles.

All 2022 data files were processed by comparetailpoints_v3.R.

comparetailpoints_v3.R was updated on April 26th, 2023 and added original body angle data.
